**Prompt**
This week I learned:
C++
* Fundamental data types: int, floating points, char, etc
* Derived data types: arrays, pointers, references
*User-defined data types: structs, class, union

Computer science
*Data structure: arrays only

Based on everything we have discussed in this chat, which includes questions and past practice problems.
Could you create a hard practice problem that builds on all the concepts learned?

**Problem**
Create a program that simulates a simple online library system. The library holds books with information like 
title, author, publication year, and genre (represented as a string). Users can perform the following actions:

* Add a book: Prompt the user for book information (title, author, year, genre) and add it to the library's 
collection (represented as an array of structs). Ensure the library doesn't already hold a book with the same 
title and author (check for duplicates).

* Search for a book: Allow users to search for books by title or author. The program should display all 
matching books or indicate if no books are found.

* Borrow a book: If a book is available (not already borrowed), mark it as borrowed and update the system.

* Return a book: If a book is borrowed, mark it as available again.

* List all books: Display information about all books in the library, including their availability status (borrowed or available).

**Concepts Used**
C++:
* Data Types: Use int for year, string for title, author, and genre.
* Structs: Create a struct named Book to store information about each book.
* Arrays: Use an array of Book structs to represent the library collection.
* Functions: Implement functions for each user action (add, search, borrow, return, list).
* Loops: Use loops to iterate through the book array for searching and listing.
* Conditional Statements: Use if statements to check for duplicates, availability, etc.

Computer Science:
* Data Structures: Utilize arrays to store the book collection.

Difficulty:
* This problem requires you to combine various C++ concepts to manage data, user interaction, and program flow. It also introduces 
basic data structure usage with arrays.

Tips:
* Start by defining the Book struct with appropriate member variables.
* Implement functions for each user action, focusing on clear logic and error handling.
* Use loops and conditional statements to search for books and manage availability.
* This problem challenges you to apply your understanding of C++ fundamentals and data structures to create a practical application.
